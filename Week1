A description of the problem and a discussion of the background:
A travel agency is launching a new travel package to bring tourists to New York City. To make the package attractive to customers,
the travel agency needs to investigate into New York City to find ways to diversify from other travel packages.In order to do this
they need to count the venues of each neighborhood and identify some of the distinct areas and provide tour guides to walk through
some of the areas with clients.
A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem:
The map data is available through Foursquare API, and the neighborhood information can be found online through zip code.
